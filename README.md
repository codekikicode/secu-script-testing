# SecuScript: Testing for Safety and Stability

## Overview
SecuScript is a project designed to merge cybersecurity practices with quality assurance (QA), ensuring systems are both resilient and reliable. The project demonstrates automated testing pipelines using Playwright and Node.js, with integration into GitHub Actions for continuous feedback.

## Vision
To build a future where secure, stable, and thoroughly tested software is the standard â€” not the exception.

## End-User
- Developers seeking fast, automated feedback on code stability
- Organizations aiming to catch vulnerabilities early in development
- QA engineers who need reusable, scalable test scripts

## Problem-Space
Manual QA testing is slow, error-prone, and often fails to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. This project aims to automate and standardize QA/security validation.

## Solution
Automated Playwright test scripts integrated with Node.js and GitHub Actions, providing continuous verification of functionality and security checks.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML/CSS (where needed for testing UI)
- **Frameworks**: Playwright, Node.js
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, VS Code, npm, CLI

## Setup (Planned)
1. Clone repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/secu-script-testing.git
   cd secu-script-testing
